**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us and we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.  
In our apps products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

**Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, Kata-kata Lucu Apps collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Kata-kata Lucu Apps’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Kata-kata Lucu Apps’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Kata-kata Lucu Apps may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Kata-kata Lucu Apps also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on blog. Kata-kata Lucu Apps only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Kata-kata Lucu Apps uses cookies to help Kata-kata Lucu Apps identify and track visitors, their usage of Kata-kata Lucu Apps website, and their website access preferences. Kata-kata Lucu Apps visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Kata-kata Lucu Apps’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Kata-kata Lucu Apps’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Ads**  
Ads appearing on any of our websites or our apps may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or your phone devices  each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer or phone devices. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Kata-kata Lucu Apps and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Click [**Here**](https://www.startapp.com/policy/sdk-policy/) for more information about StartApp SDK privacy policy.
